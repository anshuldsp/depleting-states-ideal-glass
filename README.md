## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── fig_xx/
│   ├── (data files for Figure xx)
│   └── ...
├── fig_yy/
│   ├── (data files for Figure yy)
│   └── ...
├── codes/
│   ├── (basic simulation and analysis codes)
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

- Each directory named `fig_xx` contains the **raw data used to generate the corresponding figure** in the main manuscript.
- The `codes/` directory provides ** the simulation codes** used for the majority of the numerical experiments presented in the paper.
- The scripts are intended to document the **core methodology and workflows**.

---

## Data Usage

- All data are provided **as used in the main manuscript figures**.
- File formats are kept as close as possible to those used during analysis.
- Users are encouraged to consult the paper for full scientific context, definitions, and interpretation of the data.

---

## Codes

- The codes illustrate the **essential simulation protocols and analysis pipelines**.
- They may require adaptation (e.g., paths, parameters, compiler flags) depending on the user’s computing environment.
